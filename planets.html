                        <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit
                            around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named
                            after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and
                            mediator between gods and mortals.</p>

                            beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast
                            shadows and can be, on rare occasion, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.</p>

                            support life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands.
                            The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other
                            salt-water
                            bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the
